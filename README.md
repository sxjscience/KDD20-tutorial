# KDD20 Tutorial: Practical Automated Machine Learning with Tabular, Text, and Image Data

Automated machine learning (AutoML) offers the promise of translating raw data into accurate predictions with just a few lines of code. Rather than relying on human time/effort and manual experimentation, models can be improved by simply letting the AutoML system run for more time. 

In this hands-on tutorial, we demonstrate fundamental techniques that enable powerful AutoML. We consider standard supervised learning tasks on various types of data including tables, text, and images. Rather than technical descriptions of individual ML models, we emphasize how to best use models within an overall ML pipeline that takes in raw training data and outputs predictions for test data. A major focus of our tutorial is on automating deep learning, a class of powerful techniques that are cumbersome to manage manually. Each topic covered in the tutorial is accompanied by a hands-on Jupyter notebook that implements best practices. 

Most of this code is adopted from [AutoGluon](https://github.com/awslabs/autogluon/), a recent AutoML toolkit that makes it easy to translate your data into highly accurate models: [autogluon.mxnet.io](https://autogluon.mxnet.io)

## Setup Instructions 

Before beginning the hands-on tutorials, please [install AutoGluon](https://autogluon.mxnet.io/install.html). 

Most tutorials require you to install MXNet and you can install MXNet by following the guide in [install MXNet](https://sxjscience.github.io/KDD2020/).
One tutorial also requires you to install [Pytorch](https://pytorch.org/).

A Linux machine with GPU is recommended, although you should be able to easily run the tabular data tutorials on a Mac laptop as well. 
For the week of the KDD conference, we will provide access to cloud GPUs to run the hands-on tutorials (stay tuned).
